# Security Committee

This document describes the responsibilities, organizational structure, operation mode, and related processes of the Security Committee.



## Mission

The openEuler Security Committee (SC) receives and responds to openEuler security issues, provides community security guidance, and carries out security governance. It is built to enhance the security of openEuler products and development environment.



## Responsibilities

+ Assist in fixing vulnerabilities: Ensure that known vulnerabilities are fixed in a timely manner. Provide patches for software package maintainers to help users fix vulnerabilities before virus attack. The patches include vulnerability detection and fixing tools.
+ Respond to security issues: Respond to reported security issues, track the handling progress, and disclose the reported issues in the community based on the security issue disclosure policy.
+ Popularize secure coding rules: Strive to create documentation or development tools to help the developers avoid common pitfalls in the software development process. We will also answer questions encountered during development and use.
+ Participate in code review: Help discover vulnerabilities in code in advance through code review.
