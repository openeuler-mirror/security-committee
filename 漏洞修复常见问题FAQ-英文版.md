# Frequently Asked Questions

### 1 What does "Fixed" mean?

Answer: "Fixed" indicates that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability affects the openEuler product, and the corresponding fix has been released.

### 2 What does "Affected" mean?

Answer: "Affected" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability affects the openEuler product, and efforts are being made to prepare the corresponding fix.

##### 2.1 What does "Vulnerabilities are still analyzing" mean?

Answer: "Vulnerabilities are still analyzing" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability affects the openEuler product, and efforts are being made to prepare the corresponding fix.

##### 2.2 What does "No solution or patch" mean?

Answer: "No solution or patch" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability affects the openEuler product, but there is currently no corresponding fix or patch available.

##### 2.3 What does "To be fixed through an upgraded version" mean?

Answer: "To be fixed through an upgraded version" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability affects the openEuler product, and the fix will be applied in a future version upgrade.

##### 2.4 What does "Out of support scope" mean?

Answer: "Out of support scope" means that the affected software package or version is outside the service support range of the openEuler product. It is recommended to adopt possible mitigation measures or upgrade to supported packages or versions based on the impact assessment by the openEuler security team.

##### 2.5 Why is it "Will not Fix"?

Answer: Although the vulnerability affects the openEuler product, after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was decided not to fix the vulnerability temporarily.
We recommend:

- Prioritize upgrading your product; upgrade to an openEuler product that includes the fix or is unaffected by the vulnerability.
- If there are mitigation measures available, try using them.
- Provide feedback to us, explaining the reasons why you need the fix.

### 3 Why is it "Unaffected"?

Answer: "Unaffected" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the openEuler product, so no fix is needed.

##### 3.1 What does "Component_not_present" mean?

Answer: "Component_not_present" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the openEuler product, as the relevant components affected by the vulnerability do not exist in the openEuler product.

##### 3.2 What does "Inline_mitigations_already_exist" mean?

Answer: "Inline_mitigations_already_exist" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the openEuler product, as there are already built-in inline controls or mitigation measures in the openEuler product.

##### 3.3 What does "Vulnerable_code_cannot_be_controlled_by_adversary" mean?

Answer: "Vulnerable_code_cannot_be_controlled_by_adversary" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the openEuler product, as the vulnerable code cannot be triggered by adversaries.

##### 3.4 What does "Vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path" mean?

Answer: "Vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the openEuler product, as the vulnerable code is not in the execution path.

##### 3.5 What does "Vulnerable_code_not_present" mean?

Answer: "Vulnerable_code_not_present" means that after analysis and evaluation by the openEuler security team, it was confirmed that the vulnerability does not affect the openEuler product, as the vulnerable code does not exist in the openEuler product.

##### 4 What does "Under Investigation" mean?

Answer: "Under Investigation" means that the openEuler security team is actively analyzing and evaluating the impact of the vulnerability on the openEuler product, but has not yet confirmed whether the vulnerability affects the related products.

##### 5 What is CVSS score? Why do some CVE scores differ between openEuler and NVD?

Answer: CVSS stands for Common Vulnerability Scoring System, which is a standard for scoring CVEs published and updated by the CVSS-SIG organization. The CVSSv3.1 version is referenced by openEuler. CVSS is just a general vulnerability evaluation system, and different organizations, vendors, or communities may have different business security perspectives, so the scores for the same CVE may vary.
